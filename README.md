# PROE - Propagation and Radiation of Electromagnetic Waves

This repository contains `PROE.pdf`, a comprehensive PDF that encompasses the entire content discussed in the Propagation and Radiation of Electromagnetic Waves class, and according cheatsheets.

## Key Contents

- **Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Waves**: In-depth exploration of plane waves in boundless media, dielectric and conductor characterization, and wave polarization.
- **Guided Wave Propagation and Transmission Lines**:
  - Analysis of high-frequency transmission line effects and impedance matching using the Smith chart.
  - Detailed examination of lossless and lossy lines.
  - Matching networks (quarter-wave transformer, stub...).
- **Optical Fibers**:
  - Discussion on single and multimode fibers, focusing on modes, dispersion, attenuation, and information capacity.
- **Antenna Fundamentals**:
  - Investigation of elemental antennas, parameters, arrays, and the application of image theory and mutual coupling in antenna design.
